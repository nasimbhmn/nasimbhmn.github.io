I am a psycholinguist from Iran, and I am currently working as a doctoral researcher at the Research Training Group [Nominal Modification](https://nominal-modification.de) at Goethe University Frankfurt.

I would like to understand how people produce and interpret language in real time. I am fascinated by the fact that language production and comprehension is such a fast and efficient process that happens without major disruptions: people often speak fluently and interpret others almost with no difficulty. I try to understand how this is possible by asking how speakers plan, retrieve, manipulate, and assemble linguistic units piece by piece, and how others interpret the output of this process. To answer these questions, I look at two linguistic phenomena: word order choices/preferences and language disfluencies.

My research is cross-linguistic: In my PhD project, I am working on Persian and German, and as a memebr of [Romance Lab](https://www.uni-frankfurt.de/102371493/Romance_Lab) I am working on Spanish.
