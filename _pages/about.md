I am a psycholinguist from Iran, currently a doctoral researcher at the Research Training Group [Nominal Modification](https://nominal-modification.de) at Goethe University Frankfurt.

I would like to understand how people produce and intrepret language in real time. I am fascinated by the fact that language production and comprehension is such a fast an efficient process that happens without major disruptions: people often speak fluently and interpret others almost with no difficulty. I try to understand how this is possible by asking how humans plan, retrieve, manipulate, and assemble linguistic units in a piece-by-piece fashion and how others interpret the output of this process. To answer these questions, I look at two linguistic phenomena: word order choices/preferences and language disfluencies.

My research is cross-linguistic: In my PhD project, I work on Persian and German. Also, as a memebr of [Romance Lab](https://www.uni-frankfurt.de/102371493/Romance_Lab) I work on Spanish.
